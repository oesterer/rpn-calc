Write a program that implements a command-line Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator.

Requirements:
- The calculator should run in the terminal and accept input interactively.
- Pressing enter pushes the input to the stack
- Users can enter numbers and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), the action is executed as soon as the key for the operator is pressed
- Maintain a stack for operands.
- On each operator, apply it to the last two numbers on the stack and push the result back.
- Always display the last 5 positions in the stack and refresh after each execution
- Support commands:
  - `q` or `quit` to exit
  - `clear` to reset the stack
  - `swap` swap last two items on the stack
  - `drop` remove last item from the stack
  - `dup` duplicate the last item on the stack
  - other math commands: sin, cos, inv (invert), pow (power of, second last item to the power of the last item on the stack)
- Handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., too few operands, invalid tokens).
- Print the result after each valid operation.
- The program should keep running until the user quits.

Make sure the code is well-structured, with functions for parsing input, performing operations, and running the REPL loop.



change the order of the stack, newest at the bottom

  if a stack element is empty, just use an empty string intead of "[empty]"

  when the user presses + (or any other operand) execute it immediately, do not require the user to press
  enter
